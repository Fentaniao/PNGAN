# Main Results
The quantitative results of models finetuned with the image pairs generated by our PNGAN are listed in the following table. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results.

 # Noise Generation
 The qualitative comparisons of noise generation between previous methods and our PNGAN are shown in the following figure. Our PNGAN creates more realistic and visually natural noisy images.

# Noise Removal
We provide the denoied results on [DND](https://noise.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/) benchmark, see folder 'DND_results'. Our method ranks the 4th place on the public [leaderboard](https://noise.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/benchmark/#results_srgb).
